 # Description
 
 Write a function in Swift to find the longest subsequence of array elements in consecutive order. This is, given a set of numbers, get which are the longest consecutive numbers in the array and what is the length. The consecutive numbers can be in any order. A consecutive sequence doesnâ€™t necessarily require that our elements be in ascending or descending order.

 # Longest Subsequence Function
 
 **Function**: returns the longest subsequence of concecutive elements and the number of elements in that subsequence
 
 **Parameters**: Accepts an array of integers and outputs an array of integers (longest subsequence) and single integer (length of subsequence)
 
 **Variables**
 * longestLen: tracks longest subsequence length
 * currLen: tracks current length of subsequence
 * longestSub: tracks longest subsequence of consecutive integers
 
 **Constants**
 * sortedArray: a sorted version of the input array for easier analysis of consecutive elements
 
 **Code Logic**
 * Define variables to keep track of the current length of the subsequence, longest subsequence, and longest length
 * Sort the input array to allow for easier consecutive integer comparisons
 * Iterate through the array and check if each element is consecutive
    * If the element is a consecutive element, increment the currLen count
    * Else, set currLen to 1 which acts as a form of reset
    * Check if the current subsequence length is greater than the longest subsequence length
        * If so, update the longestLen variable and update the longest subsequence array
 * Return the longest subsequence and length
